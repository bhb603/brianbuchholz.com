There is a category of "laws" that aren't strictly laws in the scientific sense
(like Newton's Laws of Motion) or legal sense (you wont be punished for breaking them), but more like rules of thumb, heuristics, or observations about the world.

Popular examples include [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law), [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), and [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

This ["Hacker Laws"](https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws) GitHub repo has a fantastic collection of such Laws, Theories, Principles, and Rules.

This post includes a discussion of my favorite laws, ones which I have found useful, particularly in my career, but also more broadly.
At best these can help frame conversations, inform thinking,
and have concrete impact on decision making.
Even if they don't deliver on such promises, at least they are fun to think about.

### Pareto Principle AKA 80/20 Rule

Roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

#### History

Italian Polymath Vilfredo Pareto originally observed in the late 1800s that 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population.
Management consultant Joseph M. Juran developed this concept in the 1940s in the context of quality control.

#### Application

I think about the 80/20 Rule all the time with respect to prioritization.
The numbers (80% and 20%) are just estimates and frankly not that important.
The key insight is that not everything has the same impact, and often a small minority of (features | bugs | lines of code | Italian land owners) have disproportionate impact on outcomes.

If there are 10 bugs in the backlog, there may be two-or-three which account for the vast majority of user complaints. Focus on those first.

If a feature or MVP has 10 acceptance criteria, often a few account for most of the user value. If possible deliver those first, and iterate on the other cases later.
